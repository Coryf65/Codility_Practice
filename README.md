## Smallest Positive Int

> that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

### Problem :

This is a demo task.

Write a function:

`class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }`

that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

For example, given `A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2]`, the function should return `5`.

Given `A = [1, 2, 3]`, the function should return `4`.

Given `A = [−1, −3]`, the function should return `1`.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

- N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
- each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].

GIVEN
```C#
using System;
// you can also use other imports, for example:
// using System.Collections.Generic;

// you can write to stdout for debugging purposes, e.g.
// Console.WriteLine("this is a debug message");

class Solution {
    public int solution(int[] A) {
        Implement your solution here
